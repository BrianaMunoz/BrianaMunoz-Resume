My name is Briana Munoz and I live in Orange County CA. I have an older sister and younger brother. I am very involved in my community. I often volunteer at the childrenâ€™s center known as Girls Inc in my city. I also am a part of the police explorer program at the Newport Beach Police Department. I have also done a mentorship at the Los Angeles Sheriffâ€™s Department where I shadowed and observed the tasks on the job. For sports I was on my high schoolâ€™s cross-country team and soccer team. I have played soccer for ten years. I currently work at Sugar n Spice in Newport Beach where I prepare and serve ice cream bars. I have recently been promoted to shift lead which makes me responsible for the store and making sure that everything is in order. At my job we also cater so I often work catering jobs when I can. These catering jobs often are for weddings, concerts, or any parties. This is my first ever job and I absolutely love it. I hope to continue working here for as long as I can. When I am not busy working or volunteering, I like to go to the beach and hang out with my friends. I like to go to the mall and shop but only when I can. I am currently a first-year sociology major at the University of California Riverside. I intend on using this major to pursue a career in the criminal justice field. I do not know exactly what I want to do for a living but I am certain that I want to it relate to criminology or criminal justice. I am involved in one on campus organization and I plan to join others if I can. My on campus organization is a sorority known as Sigma Kappa. In my sorority I hold an executive position known as Vice President of Programming. In this position I am responsible for making our quarterly calendar and conducting our meetings. I essentially am on top of what occurs during the school year. This position is very interesting and it has taught me new skills that I can possibly acquire in my career. I plan on being more involved on campus in order to acquire more skills and I plan on getting an on campus job as well depending on if I am able to or not. I do not know exactly what job I want or plan on applying for but I hope I can learn from it and possibly learn new things that will benefit me in the future. This summer I plan on working at my job back home but I also want to start applying for jobs on campus. I have some friends that work on campus and I am considering applying to their jobs but I do not know yet. I look forward to what the next school year has to offer and I can not wait to explore my options and be a student again.
